# Making Sense of UTXOs

Estimated time: 20 minutes

Goal:

- To understand how UTXOs work
- To learn how to split and merge complex UTXOs
- To get first hand experience making transactions from your terminal

In this guide, we will help you gain a better understanding of how UTXOs work by running through an example using `Plasma CLI` tool.

Unlike Ethereum, a plasma chain units of transactions are in UTXOs aka Unspent Transaction Output. If you have developed application on a Bitcoin-based blockchain, you will find the paradigm to be quite similar (with a few caveats). 

If you haven't already, make sure you have gone through the first Guide on [Running Plasma Transactions on the browser](https://github.com/omisego/dev-portal/blob/master/Guides/browser_plasma_interface.md).
